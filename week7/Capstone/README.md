Capstone Project: Build a Todo List

-Must make use of at least 2 APIs

-One to handle the CRUD applications (Bob's To-Do API would be a good place to start - see documentation (Links to an external site.))

-Another one to populate some portion of each todo. It can not be entirely hard-coded. Using any of the APIs you are familiar with is okay but be aware: if you try to use a new one, acquiring a key could take days or weeks.

-Must use the promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js, Axios

-Must be fully styled and responsive

-Must be fully functional and contain all 4 HTTP methods for RESTful services
